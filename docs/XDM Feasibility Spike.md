Additional observations, such as potential enhancements and foreseeable challenges in the data model, were also documented during the spike.

### 4. Recommendations

#### 4.1 Automated Online Documentation

- **Objective**: Streamline and automate the generation of data dictionaries and documentation.
- **Tool Selection**: Utilize tools from [json-schema.org](https://json-schema.org/implementations#documentation-generators) to automate documentation creation.
- **Implementation Guide**: Establish workflows that leverage the selected tools to generate, update, and manage documentation seamlessly.

#### 4.2 JSON Schema Repository

- **Objective**: Manage JSON schema versions, storage, and retrieval systematically.
- **Design and Architecture**: Employ a structured repository that supports easy management and retrieval of JSON schemas.
- **Usage Guide**: Implement processes for interacting with the repository, ensuring consistency and traceability.

#### 4.3 Data Engineer IDE

- **Objective**: Enhance data mapping and validation through a specialized IDE.
- **Integration Details**: Merge functionalities of the JSONata playground and JSON schema validation, utilizing tools like [jsonschemalint](https://github.com/nickcmaynard/jsonschemalint).
- **User Guide**: Craft detailed documentation that guides users through the IDE, highlighting key features and usage scenarios.

#### 4.4 Mapping Functions to JSONata GO Function Bindings

- **Objective**: Enhance consistency and performance across mappings.
- **Performance Metrics**: Referencing the transformation improvement from 200ms to 2ms through transitioning $objectsToDocument function to GO.
- **Implementation Strategy**: Develop a phased approach for transitioning functions to JSONata GO, ensuring minimal disruption and optimal performance.

#### 4.5 JSON Schema Inheritance Structure

- **Objective**: Align JSON schema inheritance with the platform architecture.
